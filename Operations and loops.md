* AssignmentAssignment operators
* ComparisonComparison operators
* ArithmeticArithmetic operators
* BitwiseBitwise operators
* LogicalLogical operators
* StringString operators
* ConditionalConditional (ternary) operator
* CommaComma operator

Bitwise operators
A bitwise operator treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers. For example, the decimal number nine has a binary representation of 1001. Bitwise operators perform their operations on such binary representations, but they return standard JavaScript numerical values.Bitwise operators
